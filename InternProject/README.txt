A simple article application with PHP and MySQL using PDO. 
There are 2 kinds of roles: admin and user. 

In order to use the application, any user needs to authenticate. If a user does not have an account, he can register by filling out a registration form.
A user can modify his info, reset his password, upload an avatar and see his articles. Also he can add/delete/update/publish/search for his articles.
Also he can change the order of his articles by preference. An admin has the same features as the user + he can see a list with all the users and add/delete and update their information.

Also anyone can see the article page of all users even if it's not logged in.
